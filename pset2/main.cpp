Title: Distances between 3D Bodies
Author: Gordon Zheng
Created on: 2014-10-28
Description:  Reads 3D positions (X, Y, Z) for between 3-36 bodies from a file,
              command line arg file1, write general stats to file passed
              in CLI arg file2, and write sorted list of bodies to file in 
              CLI arg file3.
Usage: ./bodies <file1> <file2> <file3>
Build with:   g++ main.cpp body.cpp -o bodies
Dependencies: none
